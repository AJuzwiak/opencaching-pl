>> Dependencies:
- libmysql
- SDL
- SDL_gfx >= 2.0.13
- SDL_ttf >= 2.0.10
- libpng
- SDL_image
- fcgi (for Makefile.fcgi)

>> How to compile:
For bare CGI version:
make -f Makefile.cgi

For FastCGI version:
make -f Makefile.fcgi


>> Note on FastCGI:
You can increase number of processes running by adding a rule to Apache such as

---
FastCgiServer /path/to/the/mapper/program/cgi-bin/mapper.fcgi -processes 4
---

It can help parallelize queries / rendering on distributed / multithreading systems.

>> Configuation/Database:
Edit data/mapper.ini-example and set connection details. When done, rename to mapper.ini
