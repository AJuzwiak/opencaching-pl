what_do_you_find Welcome to {site_name}
what_do_you_find_intro_pl Geocaching is an outdoor sport or activity in which cachers use a GPS receiver to find a "treasure" hidden by other participants. Caches are secured in watertight containers, containing gifts and a logbook in which they record their discovery of the cache. The coordinates of the location of the caches are stored on online databases such as opencaching.se along with descriptions and instructions necessary to find them.<br/>On this site you can find everything about geocaching in Poland. Opencaching.pl in Poland was started in <span class="content-title-noshade">May 2006</span>. This is the main Poland geocaching site. Our database working on <b>opensource project Opencaching</b>. The idea is to have several opencaching nodes for different countries around the world with a synchronized database of users and caches. Runs on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opencaching-pl/">Opencaching.PL opensource project</a>.

nc01 Dear User
nc02 Thank you for registering your cache at {site_name}. If you need help with hiding or registering the cache, please read the information at <a class="links" href="{wiki_url}">OpenGeoWiki <img src="tpl/stdstyle/images/misc/linkicon.png" alt="link"></a> or contact the Centre of the Service of Geocachers - email address: cog@opencaching.pl. Remember that your cache tells also something about you. For sure you are concerned about its best quality and due to that fact we ask you to answer yourself the following questions: <ul style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 12.5px; line-height:1.6em; text-align: left;color:blue;">
nc03 Is the cache located in place that doesn't violate the law, isn't it hidden at the private area without the permission of its owner?
nc04 Is the cache located in the area of the National Park, a reservation, monument, cemetery or some other area protected by law?
nc05 Are there any other caches in the area, is the miminum 150 meter distance preserved?
nc06 Are you able to provide service of your cache during the whole time of its presence on the webiste?
nc07 Is the cache hidden the proper way (in a cold and moisture resistant container)?
nc08 You can check your area if there is a 
nc09 Geocaching Guide
nc10 that can help you with creating your own caches
nc11 Does the cache comply with
nc12 the terms and rules of the OC PL website
nc13 Please familiarize yourself with the Guidebook
nc14 How to create a cache
